zordzman-plus-plus
==================

The best game that ever existed. Period.

Zordzman-plus-plus (Zordzman++) will be a remake of
the original Zordzman created by JavaCakess in, well, Java.
This remake shall be in C++, and will be developed by a team
rather than one person.
It uses SDL and SDL_Image for about everything right now.
Feel free to... Tag Along!
